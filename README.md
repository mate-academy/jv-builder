# jv-builder

- Given class Plane. Design class PlaneBuilder, that will implement pattern Builder.
- Plane should have at least 5 fields.
- Add all necessary changes that are required in order to implement "Builder".

P.S.
In tests we expect Builder implementation, where class Plane has private constructor, which takes builder object as input.
Class Builder is inner static with method "build" where private constructor of Plane is called.

Before sending your solution run tests in PlaneTest class and execute in main method your code:
Initialize all Plane object's fields through builder and print result to console, if 
all fields are initialized - good job, now you can submit your task.
